# Calorie-and-freshness-detection-of-fruits-and-vegetable-using-raspberry-pi
Developed an intelligent vision-based system using Raspberry Pi, Pi Camera, YOLO, and Pixtral 12B to detect fruits and vegetables, estimate their calorie content, and assess freshness in real-time.Integrated YOLO (You Only Look Once) for object detection and classification, while Pixtral 12B, a vision-language model, was used to enhance semantic understanding and generate high-level freshness insights based on visual cues. Combined image processing techniques with a nutritional dataset to estimate calorie values for each detected item.
